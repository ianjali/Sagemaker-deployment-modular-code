### Complete Machine Learning Model Deployment Pipeline on AWS SageMaker 🌟

This repository provides an end-to-end pipeline for deploying machine learning models on AWS SageMaker, from data ingestion to model inferencing.

For a step-by-step understanding, refer to my Medium article [Deploying Machine Learning Models on Amazon SageMaker](https://medium.com/@mudgal.anjali.am/deploying-machine-learning-models-on-amazon-sagemaker-a-comprehensive-guide-adb72b3b95b0)
What’s Covered in This Pipeline? 🚀
1. **Data Ingestion** 📥
Upload dataset to Amazon S3 for training and testing.

3. **Model Training** 🔧
Train the model using SageMaker with algorithms like RandomForestClassifier. Training is done on cost-effective Spot Instances.

4. **Model Deployment** 🚀
Deploy the trained model for real-time inference via SageMaker endpoints.

6. **Model Inferencing** 🔍
Perform inference on new data by sending requests to the endpoint.
